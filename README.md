# Four Elements
The Elements of Nature - Air, Water, Fire and Earth are crucial entities of life. Owing to our admiration for nature and life, we decided to apply this to our creation. We wanted our game to be something that would make the user knack their brains and not just merely "play". Hence, Four Elements is a puzzle solving game built using Flutter, Firebase and Rive.

We are a team Slate and Chalk, that started learning Flutter a year back. This is our first try at a game, after the development of an app. One of biggest challenges that we had to go through was the development of a particular level in the game. Yet we managed to sort out the rest and bring the game to life.

Though this is our first attempt, we are very proud that we've pulled it off as expected. This is a real accomplishment to the team. On the run, we have mastered Flutter along with learning to work as a team. We have learnt the art of incorporating each of our skillset accordingly to bring out the ideas in our brain.

Four Elements is mainly developed for the sole purpose of this contest. However, we plan on upgrading the game by bringing out more challenges to the game, simultaneously sorting out the challenges that we faced during the building. We will also improvise the gaming experience accordingly.
